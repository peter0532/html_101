    <p>This page sets forth the nuts and bolts of creating a page in any namespace â€“ the mechanics of doing so. Please note that only logged in users can create pages in non-talk namespaces.</p>
    <p>This page does not delve into the reasons one should or should not create a page, what to consider before doing so, nor what content would or would not be appropriate. For a more general treatment regarding the DOs and DON'Ts of article creation, please see Help:Your first article. For a general introduction to contributing, see Wikipedia:Contributing to Wikipedia and consider taking a tour through the Wikipedia:Tutorial. For a guided process to create an article (and for which these technical instructions will not be needed), see the article wizard and Wikipedia:Articles for creation, where a proposed article will first be created as a draft and then submitted for review before possible "publication" by a move to the article mainspace.

    <p>For relevant considerations before creating an encyclopedia article, please see the main notability guideline, our policies on verifiability, writing from a neutral point of view, our restrictions on original research and our guide to what Wikipedia is not. For styling issues, see the manual of style and the article layout guideline. For what title to choose for an article, see the article titling policy.
